Nightmare Eika Ebisu
Embodiment of Death
Ability: Invoking Death

As one of the four horseriders of the apocalypse, the embodiment of death
is a fearful nightmare being. It has dawned the appearance of Eika Ebisu,
as per the request of their new master.
She now roams the fields of the dream realm, turning it into a graveyard.
Once she finds a poor soul to capture, she instantly kills them, and makes them
a new grave.

========================================

Nightmare Urumi Ushizaki
Embodiment of Pestilence
Ability: Invoking Illness and Plagues

Another horserider of the apocalpyse, the embodiment of pestilence has
found great joy in turning a once crystal clear river, into a toxic pool
of bacteria and poisons.
Anyone brave or foolish enough to set foot above the river, is bound to be
struck by the worst illnesses known to man, with no known cure to save them.

========================================

Nightmare Kutaka Niwatari
Embodiment of Famine
Ability: Destroying Crops and Wildlife

The third horserider of the apocalpyse has made their new habitat in a 
once lush oasis in the dream realm. She soon started destroying all crops,
plants and wildlife, quickly turning the whole area into a desolate desert.
The area is vast and dry, which quickly invokes hunger and thirst, making it
extremely hard to traverse it.

=======================================

Nightmare Yachie Kicchou
Embodiment of War
Ability: Instigating War

The final horserider of the apocalypse chose to reside at the southern
pole of the dream realm, located directly above the nightmare realm.
These poles are extremely cold and hostile enviroments, and are almost
always plagued by harsh blizzards, making it very hard to travel towards
the nightmare realm, without proper preparations.

=======================================

Nightmare Seraph
Forgotten Nightmare of the Past
Ability: Unknown

An unkown entity, which resides in the nightmare realm.
It often haunted the dreams of Jessica, as it represents a deep fear of hers.
In the past, she and Seraph had a fierce fight, which ended in Seraph going
fully berserk, into a "beast-like" state. This event, to this day, still
traumatizes her deeply, and her fears have taken shape in this apparition
inside the nightmare realm, where it roams to this day.

======================================

Lucidia Kaiza
Newly Declared Ruler of the Dream Realm
Ability: Total Control over Dreams

The Lucid Gem is an ancient and powerful artifact, which is grown by the
Lucid Tree in the center of the Dream Realm. With its power, anyone with
ancient blood is able to use it, to control dreams themselves.

Once Jessica found out about this artifact, she was able to get her hands on it
through unknown means. This was the beginning of the Dream Rebellion, as she used
the Gem's power to help the dream dwellers fulfill their deepest dreams and wishes.

However, this didn't last long, as soon, after one of Jessica's adventures into another
realm, the Gem started to create a soul and mind of its own, which leeched off of Jessica's
mental state, slowly driving her insane, and turning her into a crazed ruler.

After Reimu and the others defeated her, and removed the Gem from Jessica, it was left inside
the Deep Dream Citadel. However, it still had a desire to rule, to change the dream realm
into an ideal form. Soon after the dream festival, Jessica went to sleep, and her dream dweller
was captured and taken over by the gem, which now went by the name of Lucida Kaiza.

A distant voice called her into the nightmare realm, where she set up her base of operations,
sending out nightmares into the dream realm, to cause fear and destruction. Once the
dream realm was fully destroyed, she planned to rebirth it from the ashes, becoming
the new queen and ruler of her own land.
