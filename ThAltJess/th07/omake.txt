In the magical land of Gensokyo, winter had run its course, and everyone was ready to greet the arrival of spring.
However, no matter how much they waited, spring would not come, and the essence of winter remained.

In the Hakurei Shrine, two shivering girls could be found.

Reimu: T-this winter is absolutely ridiculous...
Jessica: Y-yeah, if only I had fire powers as well.
Reimu: I'm not sure if sitting around and shivering will get anything done though.
Jessica: I think I know what you are getting at...
Reimu: Exactly, if you'd be so kind and figure out why winter won't go away, I'd greatly appreciate it.
Jessica: Isn't that a bit of a huge task for someone like me?
Reimu: Hey, I saw how you handled the last incident, I'm sure you are more than capable.
Jessica: Well, I did practice using spellcards some, so maybe I can do it.
Reimu: Great, off you go then!
Jessica: Wait! My coat is great and all, but I dont think it can withstand the outside right now. Do you have anything warm?
Reimu: Lets see...Oh yes, I have this scarf! You can have it.
Jessica: Wow, thats very warm and fuzzy. Thank you!
Reimu: Good luck, I'll be waiting in the warmth of my kotatsu.

And so, Jessica, the new shrine resident, went off on her quest to find the cause of this abnormally long winter.
But where she would end up, would reveal more than she may have asked for...
