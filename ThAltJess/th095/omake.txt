A gentle evening at the Hakurei Shrine.
The spring of many flowers has come to an end, and the warm summer nights have come forth.
On the porch of the shrine sits a troubled girl, dressed in green, pondering her life.

Jessica: So far, Reimu's bracelet seems to be working. That's such a huge relief...

Just then, some rustling could be heard in the nearby shrubbery.

Jessica: If you want to spy on me, at least do it without being so creepy.
Aya: Ahaha, I'm sorry.
Jessica: Of course it would be you, nosy tengu.
Aya: Hey, no need to be so mean about it!
Jessica: What do you want?
Aya: Well, I've overheard some interesting things, and it seems you had a talk with the Yama.
Jessica: Uh-huh...I'd rather not talk about that.
Aya: I understand. Actually, I'm here for something else.
Jessica: What would that be?
Aya: After the great tengu heard about your recent accomplishments, she wanted to present you with a gift.
Jessica: A...gift? Why?
Aya: See it more as a job offer. Us tengu can always use new manpower to report on the happenings in Gensokyo.
Jessica: A camera and an...album? Sorry, but I'm not interested in doing oddjobs for you tengu.
Aya: Keep it anyways, maybe you'll want to chronicle some of the people you met for your personal use.
Jessica: Thanks...I guess?
Aya: Well, I have to be off! Think about that job offer!

With a camera now in her possesion, Jessica ponders once more.
Jessica: Hmm...I suppose I can use this to take my mind off of the other thing.
