The Hakurei Shrine, a Shrine at the edge of Gensokyo's Border.
The Shrine has been blessed by plenty of flower petals during this wonderful spring.

Jessica: You know Reimu, it's been very peaceful since last autumn. Don't you think thats a bit odd?
Reimu: What do you mean? I'm glad that there's nothing going on for a while. Last year was very exhausting.
Jessica: For me, sure. What did you even do?
Reimu: Solve the feast incident.
Jessica: Ok sure, but I did everything else.
Reimu: Now that you mention it though, there is one odd thing about this spring.
Jessica: Really? It just seems like a really beautiful spring season to me.
Reimu: Exactly. TOO beautiful, maybe. Have you seen all the flowers blooming? I've never seen that many before.
Jessica: I see nothing wrong with this. Why not just enjoy it to its fullest?
Reimu: Maybe you're right...
Jessica: I'm gonna head out for a while, if thats alright with you.
Reimu: Sure, today is pretty nice for a walk, enjoy yourself.
Jessica: This new dress I got from Korindou is very lovely, it would be a waste not to show it off a bit, hehe.


Yes, this spring may be a very calm occurence, however a dark secret still lies beneath the flowers.
But Jessica would find out her own dark secret soon enough...
Change is looming over the horizon.
